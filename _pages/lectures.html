        <p class="text-muted">
          <strong>Summary:</strong>
          Introduction into AR/VR and Metaverse. This lecture explores the fundamentals of AR, VR, MR (Mixed Reality), 
          XR (Extended Reality), Metaverse, and AI. You will examine the connections between these concepts and how these technologies influence 
          and integrate into various aspects of our lives, industries, and society.

            <h5>Video 1.1 – Definition of the Metaverse</h5>
            <p>We take a moment to dive into the Metaverse and explore what it really means. You may have heard a lot about it in the media before, especially with Facebook’s rebrand to Meta back in 2021, but the Metaverse is far more than just a buzzword. It’s a vast, 3D virtual space that is powered by a mix of advanced technologies—everything from virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain. These technologies work together, allowing people to interact not just with each other, but sometimes even with non-human avatars.
                You might recognize elements of the Metaverse from movies and books, where visions of the future show us what this virtual world might look like. What’s fascinating is that the idea of the Metaverse has evolved from a niche, futuristic concept to something much bigger—it's now a mainstream business strategy. In fact, back in 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, changed the company’s name to Meta and unveiled his vision for the Metaverse.
                So, what exactly is the Metaverse made up of? Well, it’s a space that enables communication, requires creators to design both spaces and avatars, and blends VR and AR technologies to create the experience.</p>

            <p>
                What exactly does it mean to build the metaverse? To understand this, you will be guided through a conceptual view of the metaverse, introduced by Jon Radoff. Rather than a single software platform, he describes the metaverse as a digital environment comprising seven distinct layers. Exploring these seven layers will allow you to see what the metaverse is from different angles.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Experience:</strong> The front-end layer where users interact with immersive and engaging digital experiences. This includes games, virtual social spaces, virtual events, esports, theatre, shopping, and simulations that bring the metaverse to life.<br>
                <strong>Discovery:</strong> This layer mainly involves content consumption. It includes the mechanisms through which people discover metaverse content and experiences, including search engines, app stores, social media, and community-driven sharing platforms.<br>
                <strong>Creator Economy:</strong> Focuses on tools, platforms, and systems that enable individuals and businesses to create, design, and monetize digital content, assets, and experiences in the metaverse.<br>
                <strong>Spatial Computing:</strong> Technologies that enable 3D mapping, AR/VR, and real-time rendering to blend the physical and digital worlds. This layer includes tools like augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.<br>
                <strong>Decentralization:</strong> The use of blockchain, peer-to-peer networking, and decentralized protocols to ensure ownership, governance, and control are distributed rather than centralized.<br>
                <strong>Human-Computer Interaction:</strong> The interfaces and devices that connect humans to the metaverse, such as VR headsets, smartglasses, wearables, haptic devices, gesture recognition, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).<br>
                <strong>Infrastructure:</strong> The foundational technologies that power the metaverse, including cloud computing, 5G networks, GPUs, data centers, and other hardware that ensure connectivity, scalability, and performance.

                <p>
                    As technology continues to advance, some concepts often overlap and become conflated. One common example is the association of the metaverse with Web 3.0. Many people think the metaverse is the same as Web 3.0. While they are connected in some ways, they are different. This video looks at the differences between them, by first looking at Web 1.0 and 2.0 and progressing to Web 3.0 and its association with the metaverse.
