	<h3>Bio</h3>
	<p>Yulia Gryaditskaya is a <strong>Senior Research Scientist</strong> at Adobe, UK.</p>

	<p>Prior to that, she was an <strong>Assistant Professor</strong> (2022–2024) at the 
		<a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing">Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP)</a> 
		and the <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence">Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI</a>. 
		During this time, she supervised PhD, master's, and bachelor's students and taught two modules: 
		(1) Computer Graphics and Vision and (2) VR, AR, and the Metaverse. 
		
		She developed the <i>VR, AR, and the Metaverse</i> module from scratch, which is now part of the 
		University of Surrey’s online master's program. Additionally, she earned a 
		<i>Postgraduate Degree in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education</i>.
		
		She initially joined CVSSP as a <strong>Senior Research Fellow</strong> (2020–2022) on a research-only track. 
		During her time at Surrey, she supervised and co-supervised eight PhD students in areas such as 
		<i>sketch-based modeling and retrieval, sketch understanding, and sketch generation</i>.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>Before joining CVSSP, she was a <strong>Postdoctoral Researcher</strong> (2017–2020) at Inria, 
		working in the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/graphdeco/">GraphDeco</a> group under the supervision of 
		<a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/">Dr. Adrien Bousseau</a>. 
		Her research focused on <i>concept sketching techniques, sketch understanding, and sketch-based modeling</i>.
	</p>

	<p>She earned her <strong>PhD in 2017</strong> from 
		<a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/">MPI Informatics</a>, Germany, under the guidance of 
		<a href="https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~karol/">Prof. Karol Myszkowski</a> and 
		<a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=s2Ibok8AAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Hans-Peter Seidel</a>. 
		Her PhD research focused on <i>High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging</i>, covering topics such as 
		HDR calibration, HDR video capture on mobile devices, tone mapping, structured light fields, 
		and material editing in such light fields.
	</p>

	<p>During her PhD, she spent six months with the <strong>Color and HDR Group</strong> at 
		<a href="https://www.technicolor.com/contact/research-and-innovation">Technicolor R&D</a>, Rennes, France, 
		under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.erikreinhard.com/about.html">Dr. Erik Reinhard</a>.
	</p>

	<p>She holds a degree (2007–2012) in 
		<a href="http://www.msu.ru/en/info/struct/depts/vmc.html">Applied Mathematics and Computer Science</a> 
		with a specialization in <strong>Operations Research and System Analysis</strong> from the 
		<a href="http://www.msu.ru/en/info/">Lomonosov Moscow State University</a>.
	</p>

	<p>Yulia’s research has been published in top computer graphics and vision venues, 
		including <strong>ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), Computer Graphics Forum (CGF), IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), 
		ACM SIGGRAPH, ECCV, ICCV, ICLR, CVPR, and IEEE 3DV</strong>. 
		She is also a co-author of an <strong>international patent</strong> based on her CGF publication.
